# Change: Solution Architecture Layer — Derive, Store, Validate

## Why




Architectural decisions live in separate ADRs or Confluence pages with zero programmatic links to requirements or code. This is the layer where the costliest misalignments occur — a wrong architectural choice invalidates entire implementation efforts regardless of code quality. No tool today systematically connects business requirements → architectural decisions → implementation. A solution architecture module that derives, stores, and validates architecture with explicit traceability to requirements closes the biggest blind spot in the end-to-end chain.

## Ownership Alignment (2026-04-08)

- Repository assignment: `nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules`
- Modules-owned scope retained here: bundle-side runtime delivery, command wiring, and execution behavior for architecture workflows.
- Core counterpart retained in `nold-ai/specfact-cli` issue [#240](https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli/issues/240)
- Target hierarchy: modules Epic [#144](https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules/issues/144) -> Feature [#161](https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules/issues/161) -> Story [#164](https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules/issues/164)
- Shared schemas, contracts, and cross-change semantics remain owned by the core counterpart and MUST NOT be redefined here.
- Package and command examples below describe the runtime follow-up only and must be adapted to the canonical grouped bundle surface during implementation.

```

  src/architecture/
    __init__.py
    main.py                    # typer.Typer app — architecture command group
    engine/
      deriver.py               # Derive architecture from requirements (template + AI-assisted)
      coverage_validator.py    # Validate architecture covers all requirements
      trace_builder.py         # Build architecture ↔ requirements traceability links

    storage/
      architecture_store.py    # Read/write .specfact/architecture/*.arch.yaml
```

**`module-package.yaml` declares:**
- `name: architecture`
- `version: 0.1.0`
- `commands: [architecture derive, architecture validate-coverage, architecture trace]`
- `dependencies: [requirements-01-data-model, requirements-02-module-commands]`
- `schema_extensions:` — via arch-07
- `publisher:` + `integrity:` — arch-06 marketplace readiness

## What Changes




- **NEW**: Pydantic domain models in `modules/architecture/src/architecture/models/`:
  - `SolutionArchitecture` — architecture ID, requirement IDs (traceability links), components, data flows, ADRs
  - `ComponentSpec` — name, responsibility, business rule IDs (from requirements), integrations
  - `DataFlow` — source, target, data type, protocol
  - `ADR` — ADR ID, decision, rationale (links to architectural constraints from requirements), alternatives considered, tradeoff
- **NEW**: `specfact architecture derive --requirements .specfact/requirements/ --suggest-components --interactive` — derive architecture from requirements using templates and optional AI assistance
- **NEW**: `specfact architecture validate-coverage` — verify every business rule maps to a component, every architectural constraint has an ADR, every component has spec coverage
- **NEW**: `specfact architecture trace --format table|json|markdown` — show traceability matrix: requirements ↔ components ↔ ADRs ↔ specs
- **NEW**: Storage convention: `.specfact/architecture/{architecture_id}.arch.yaml`
- **NEW**: Architecture templates for common patterns (microservice, monolith, event-driven) — profile-aware complexity
- **EXTEND**: `ProjectBundle` extended with optional `architecture` field via arch-07 schema extensions (namespace: `architecture.solution_architecture`)

## Capabilities
