# Change: Traceability Index & Orphan Detection

## Why




As the number of requirements, specs, and code modules grows, manually tracking traceability becomes impossible. Teams need a fast, queryable index that maps every artifact to its upstream/downstream counterparts — and actively detects orphans (artifacts with broken or missing links). This index is the backbone for the full-chain validation, coverage dashboards, and ceremony enrichment. Without it, traceability is a write-once artifact that decays the moment someone adds a new endpoint without linking it.

## Ownership Alignment (2026-04-08)

- Repository assignment: `nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules`
- Modules-owned scope retained here: bundle-side query/report delivery and runtime trace indexing behavior for traceability workflows.
- Core counterpart retained in `nold-ai/specfact-cli` issue [#242](https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli/issues/242)
- Target hierarchy: modules Epic [#144](https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules/issues/144) -> Feature [#161](https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules/issues/161) -> Story [#170](https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules/issues/170)
- Shared schemas, contracts, and cross-change semantics remain owned by the core counterpart and MUST NOT be redefined here.
- Package and command examples below describe the runtime follow-up only and must be adapted to the canonical grouped bundle surface during implementation.

**`module-package.yaml` declares:**

- `version: 0.1.0`
- `commands: [trace index, trace show, trace orphans, trace matrix]`
- `dependencies: [requirements-02-module-commands, architecture-01-solution-layer]`
- `publisher:` + `integrity:` — arch-06 marketplace readiness

## What Changes




- **NEW**: Trace module in `modules/trace/` with auto-maintained traceability index
- **NEW**: `specfact trace index --rebuild` — scan all requirements, architecture, specs, code, and test artifacts to build a comprehensive traceability index stored at `.specfact/trace/index.json`
- **NEW**: `specfact trace show REQ-123` — query upstream/downstream links for any artifact (requirement, component, spec operation, code module, test)
- **NEW**: `specfact trace orphans` — detect orphaned artifacts: specs with no requirement, code with no spec, requirements with no architecture coverage, tests with no code reference
- **NEW**: `specfact trace matrix --format markdown|csv|json` — export traceability matrix showing the full chain for each requirement
- **NEW**: Incremental index updates — when a single file changes, update only affected trace entries (not full rebuild)
- **NEW**: TraceIndex model with bidirectional links: each entry stores both `upstream_refs` and `downstream_refs`

## Capabilities
### New Capabilities

- `traceability-index`: Auto-maintained bidirectional traceability index mapping requirements → architecture → specs → code → tests, with orphan detection, incremental updates, and matrix export in markdown/CSV/JSON.

### Modified Capabilities

(none)
