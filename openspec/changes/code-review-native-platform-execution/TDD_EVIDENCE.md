# Current candidate-tool evidence — 2026-09-30

Scope: bounded local OCI candidate verification only. Native runtime production is blocked by the lifecycle failures in NATIVE_RESULTS.md. Requirements remain planned for the full capsule; these results do not advance native release acceptance.

## Specification and failing-first sequence

The local Docker identity/promotion scenarios were added to `specs/review-native-platform-execution/spec.md` before the verifier implementation. Tests cover exact platform metadata, digests/sizes/diff IDs, payload bytes and regular-file modes, canonical paths, links/special files, resource bounds, JSON types and unconditional experimental status.

Command from the worktree root:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest -o addopts= -p no:cacheprovider tests/unit/test_macos_capsule_candidate.py -q
```

- Initial run: exit 1, 27 errors because the implementation was absent.
- Malformed-deflate regression: exit 1, one failure and 27 passes; `zlib.error` escaped the API. Added the error translation only after observing failure.
- Schema-type regression: exit 1, two failures and 30 passes; floating-point schema versions were accepted. Added exact integer checks after observing failure.
- Final focused run: exit 0, 32 passed.
- Focused Ruff check/format and BasedPyright: passed, zero type errors/warnings.
- Self-contained candidate-build/README.md reproduction: passed against the local Docker daemon; verifier manifest/config identities match the Docker export receipt.

The Docker proof retains actual `darwin/arm64` metadata. The verifier never executes/extracts the archive, does not authenticate operator-supplied native claims, and always emits `production_eligible=false`. Its input/memory bounds deliberately support a tiny fixture, not a complete analyzer closure. Native baseline remains unsupported; no production Linux/macOS acceptance pass is claimed.

## Review-driven correction and repository gates

The initial local SpecFact review found complexity/nesting, fixture naming, CLI output and missing-contract findings. The parser and test fixtures were split into focused helpers; the public verification API now enforces ineligibility through a postcondition. The private CLI adapter is exercised through real subprocess tests. All 32 cases still pass. An isolated CrossHair environment supplies its pytest/icontract imports; no global interpreter installation was changed.

Final local review used `--enforcement changed --bug-hunt --json --out .specfact/code-review.json` for the two staged Python files: PASS, zero findings. This uses the repository's existing development-source review behavior and is not native capsule acceptance. Raw local reports remain ignored.

Full tests passed with 3,046 passes, one Linux proc-contract skip and two dependency deprecation warnings. Contract tests passed 28 cases. Repository format/type/lint, YAML/manifests, bundle imports, module payload/version verification, planned Requirements evidence, strict OpenSpec and structural Markdown/whitespace checks passed. No signed module payload changed.

Final smart-test run (`hatch run smart-test -o 'addopts=-ra --import-mode=importlib' -q`) passed: 3,046 passed, one Linux-only skip, two dependency deprecation warnings. Earlier invocation removed importlib mode; a subsequent run exposed an isolated review environment outside the recognized `.venv` directory. Correcting the invocation and relocating that tool environment resolved both without changing production guards.
