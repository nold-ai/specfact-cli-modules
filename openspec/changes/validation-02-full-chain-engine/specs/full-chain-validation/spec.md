## Scope rescope — 2026-09-20

Consume independent current_execution and optional chronology without inflating test results into full requirement coverage. The full validation graph is not a prerequisite for <https://github.com/nold-ai/specfact-cli-modules/issues/481> or ordinary current-run validation.

This owner-requested planning amendment supersedes conflicting default-workflow and dependency wording below; runtime behavior is unchanged. [Replacement policy](../../../requirements-09-minimal-evidence/proposal.md).

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Full Chain Validation

The system SHALL validate Requirement -> Architecture -> Spec -> Code -> Test transitions and emit layered evidence.

The system SHALL represent `current_execution` independently from optional historical chronology. Current passing tests SHALL NOT establish historical failing-before evidence, full requirement coverage or protected CI authority. Missing requirement/architecture/spec mappings SHALL remain unassessed coverage or explicit findings under the selected graph policy, never fabricated completeness. Independent producer verdicts SHALL retain their original status and source reference. Ordinary current-run verification SHALL NOT require full-chain execution, chronology, transcripts, approval receipts or duplicate proof execution.

#### Scenario: Full-chain command emits transition-level results

- **GIVEN** `specfact validate --full-chain --output json --evidence-dir .specfact/evidence/`
- **WHEN** validation runs
- **THEN** report includes transition groups `req_to_arch`, `arch_to_spec`, `spec_to_code`, and `code_to_tests`
- **AND** each group reports pass/fail/advisory counts.

#### Scenario: Severity respects policy mode and profile

- **GIVEN** enterprise profile with hard mode
- **WHEN** a required Req -> Arch mapping is missing
- **THEN** overall validation exits non-zero
- **AND** evidence marks the violation as blocking.

#### Scenario: Orphan detection is included in evidence

- **GIVEN** specs without requirement links exist
- **WHEN** full-chain validation runs
- **THEN** orphan entries are listed in evidence
- **AND** orphan summary is included in overall status computation.

#### Scenario: Code quality can be included without becoming a chain layer

- **GIVEN** `specfact validate --full-chain --with-code-quality` is executed
- **WHEN** the validation run completes
- **THEN** the evidence output includes a `code_quality` summary sourced from `specfact review`
- **AND** the traceability layers remain limited to `req_to_arch`, `arch_to_spec`, `spec_to_code`, and `code_to_tests`

#### Scenario: Current tests pass while graph coverage is incomplete

- **GIVEN** ordinary current tests pass and required graph mappings are absent
- **WHEN** evidence is evaluated or serialized
- **THEN** `current_execution` remains separate from incomplete graph coverage
- **AND** missing mappings retain their own findings or unassessed status rather than becoming complete coverage
- **AND** no historical chronology or protected CI authority is inferred.

#### Scenario: Independent producer failure survives current test success

- **GIVEN** current tests pass but an independently required review or policy producer fails
- **WHEN** evidence is evaluated or serialized
- **THEN** both original verdicts and source references remain available
- **AND** the passing test result does not turn the failed required gate into acceptance.

#### Scenario: Current-only evidence has no historical receipt

- **GIVEN** a valid current-run result with no historical chronology or prior session receipt
- **WHEN** ordinary current-run verification consumes it
- **THEN** absence of optional history does not invalidate the current-execution claim
- **AND** no full-chain run, transcript, approval receipt or duplicate proof execution is required.
