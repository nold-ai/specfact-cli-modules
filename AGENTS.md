# AGENTS.md

This file is the mandatory bootstrap governance surface for coding agents working in this repository. It is intentionally compact. The detailed rules that used to live here have been preserved in `docs/agent-rules/` so new sessions do not pay the full context cost up front.

## Mandatory bootstrap

1. Read this file.
2. Read [docs/agent-rules/INDEX.md](docs/agent-rules/INDEX.md).
3. Read [docs/agent-rules/05-non-negotiable-checklist.md](docs/agent-rules/05-non-negotiable-checklist.md).
4. Detect repository root, active branch, and worktree state.
5. Reject implementation from the `dev` or `main` checkout unless the user explicitly overrides that rule.
6. If GitHub hierarchy metadata is needed and `.specfact/backlog/github_hierarchy_cache.md` is missing or stale, refresh it with `python scripts/sync_github_hierarchy_cache.py`.
7. Load any additional rule files required by the applicability matrix in [docs/agent-rules/INDEX.md](docs/agent-rules/INDEX.md) before implementation.

## Precedence

1. Direct system and developer instructions
2. Explicit user override where repository governance allows it
3. This file
4. [docs/agent-rules/05-non-negotiable-checklist.md](docs/agent-rules/05-non-negotiable-checklist.md)
5. Other selected files under `docs/agent-rules/`
6. Change-local OpenSpec artifacts and workflow notes

## Non-negotiable gates

- Work in a git worktree unless the user explicitly overrides that rule.
- Do not implement from the `dev` or `main` checkout by default.
- Treat a provided OpenSpec change id as candidate scope, not automatic permission to proceed.
- Verify the selected change against current repository reality and dependency state before implementation.
- Do not auto-refine stale or ambiguous changes without the user.
- Perform `spec -> tests -> failing evidence -> code -> passing evidence` in that order for behavior changes.
- Require public GitHub metadata completeness before implementation when linked issue workflow applies: parent, labels, project assignment, blockers, and blocked-by relationships.
- If a linked GitHub issue is already `in progress`, pause and ask for clarification before implementation.
- Run the required verification and quality gates for the touched scope before finalization.
- Fix SpecFact code review findings, including warnings, unless a rare explicit exception is documented.
- Treat the clean-code compliance gate as mandatory: the review surface enforces `naming`, `kiss`, `yagni`, `dry`, and `solid` categories and blocks regressions.
- Enforce module signatures and version bumps when signed module assets or manifests are affected.
- Finalize completed OpenSpec changes with `openspec archive <change-id>` (see [docs/agent-rules/40-openspec-and-tdd.md](docs/agent-rules/40-openspec-and-tdd.md)); do not manually move change folders under `openspec/changes/archive/`.

## Strategic context

This public modules repository does not depend on a sibling internal wiki checkout for change design. Shared design and governance context lives in the paired public `specfact-cli` repository and the active OpenSpec artifacts in this repo. When a modules change is explicitly paired with a core change, review both public change folders before widening scope or redefining shared workflow semantics.

Detailed guidance was moved by reference, not removed. If a rule seems missing here, consult the canonical rule docs before assuming the instruction was dropped.
