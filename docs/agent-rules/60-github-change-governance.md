# Agent GitHub change governance

## Hierarchy cache

`.specfact/backlog/github_hierarchy_cache.md` is the local lookup source for current Epic and Feature hierarchy metadata in this repository. It is ephemeral local state and must not be committed.

- Consult the cache first before creating a new change issue, syncing an existing change, or resolving parent or blocker metadata.
- If the cache is missing or stale, rerun `python scripts/sync_github_hierarchy_cache.py`.
- Use manual GitHub lookup only when the cache cannot answer the question after refresh.

## Public-work readiness checks

Before implementation on a publicly tracked change issue:

- Ensure the hierarchy cache is fresh enough for live issue-state checks.
- Verify the linked issue exists.
- Verify its parent relationship is correct against current cache-backed GitHub reality.
- Verify required labels are present.
- Verify project assignment is present.
- Verify blockers and blocked-by relationships are complete.

## Concurrency ambiguity

If the linked GitHub issue appears to be `in progress`, do not treat that as blocking until you have a current view of GitHub state:

1. If `.specfact/backlog/github_hierarchy_cache.md` is missing, or was last updated more than about five minutes ago, run `python scripts/sync_github_hierarchy_cache.py`.
2. Re-read the issue state from GitHub or the refreshed cache-backed workflow and confirm the issue is still `in progress`.
3. Only after that verification, if it remains `in progress`, pause implementation and ask the user to clarify whether the change is already being worked in another session.
