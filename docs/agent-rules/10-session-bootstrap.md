# Agent session bootstrap

## Required startup checks

1. Detect repository root, active branch, and whether the session is running in a worktree.
2. If the session is on `dev` or `main`, do not implement until the user explicitly allows it or a worktree is created.
3. Confirm `AGENTS.md` is already loaded, then load the rule index and non-negotiable checklist.
4. Determine whether the task is read-only, artifact-only, or implementation work.
5. If GitHub hierarchy data is required, confirm `.specfact/backlog/github_hierarchy_cache.md` is present and fresh enough for the task.
6. If the cache is missing or stale, refresh it with `python scripts/sync_github_hierarchy_cache.py`.
7. Load the additional rule files required by the task signal from the index.

## Hatch environment bootstrap

- In a fresh worktree, run the first Hatch command serially and wait for it to complete before starting any other `hatch run ...` process.
- Do not launch parallel Hatch commands until the worktree environment has successfully run `hatch run python -m pip --version` or another Hatch command that proves the environment is fully created.
- If Hatch reports missing `pip._internal` modules or other partial `pip` imports, treat the local `.venv` as corrupted: remove the Hatch environment, recreate it with one serial Hatch command, and retry validation only after `pip` is healthy.
- Do not interpret Hatch environment-creation failures as code failures until the local environment has been recreated serially.

## Stop and continue behavior

- If the session is on the main checkout and the user did not override, stop implementation and create or switch to a worktree.
- If the requested work is tied to stale or ambiguous change metadata, continue only in read-only investigation mode until the user clarifies.
- If GitHub hierarchy metadata is needed and the cache cannot answer after refresh, manual GitHub lookup is allowed.
- If the task is purely explanatory or read-only, full implementation gates do not need to run.

## Why this file exists

This file keeps session bootstrap deterministic after `AGENTS.md` becomes compact. It is small enough to load every time, but specific enough to prevent drift across models and sessions.
