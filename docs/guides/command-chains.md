# Command Chains Reference

> **Complete guide to SpecFact CLI command chains and workflows**

---

## Overview

Command chains are sequences of SpecFact CLI commands that work together to achieve specific goals. Each chain represents a complete workflow from start to finish, with decision points and expected outcomes documented.

**Why use command chains?** Instead of learning individual commands in isolation, command chains show you how to combine commands to solve real-world problems. They provide context, decision points, and links to detailed guides.

## Module System Context

These chains run on SpecFact's module-first architecture:

- Core runtime handles lifecycle, registry, contracts, and orchestration.
- Feature command logic is implemented in module-local command groups.
- Legacy command paths are compatibility shims during migration windows.

This keeps chains stable while modules evolve independently.

This document covers all 10 identified command chains:

- **7 Mature Chains**: Well-established workflows with comprehensive documentation
- **3 Emerging Chains**: AI-assisted workflows that integrate with IDE slash commands

## 1. Brownfield Modernization Chain

**Goal**: Modernize legacy code safely by extracting specifications, creating plans, and enforcing contracts.

**When to use**: You have existing code that needs modernization, refactoring, or migration.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Extract specifications from legacy code
specfact code import legacy-api --repo .

# Step 2: Review the extracted plan
specfact plan review legacy-api

# Step 3: Update features based on review findings
specfact plan update-feature --bundle legacy-api --feature <feature-id>

# Step 4: Enforce SDD (Spec-Driven Development) compliance
specfact enforce sdd --bundle legacy-api

# Step 5: Run full validation suite
specfact repro --verbose
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Legacy Codebase] -->|import from-code| B[Extract Specifications]
    B --> C[Plan Review]
    C -->|Issues Found| D[Update Features]
    C -->|No Issues| E[Enforce SDD]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Run Validation]
    F -->|Pass| G[Modernized Code]
    F -->|Fail| D
```

**Decision Points**:

- **After `import from-code`**: Review the extracted plan. If features are incomplete or incorrect, use `plan update-feature` to refine them.
- **After `plan review`**: If ambiguities are found, resolve them before proceeding to enforcement.
- **After `enforce sdd`**: If compliance fails, update the plan and re-run enforcement.
- **After `repro`**: If validation fails, fix issues and re-run the chain from the appropriate step.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Complete specification extracted from legacy code
- Plan bundle with features, stories, and acceptance criteria
- SDD-compliant codebase
- Validated contracts and tests

---

## 2. Greenfield Planning Chain

**Goal**: Plan new features from scratch using Spec-Driven Development principles.

**When to use**: You're starting a new feature or project and want to plan it properly before coding.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize a new plan bundle
specfact plan init new-feature --interactive

# Step 2: Add features to the plan
specfact plan add-feature --bundle new-feature --name "User Authentication"

# Step 3: Add user stories to features
specfact plan add-story --bundle new-feature --feature <feature-id> --story "As a user, I want to log in"

# Step 4: Review the plan for completeness
specfact plan review new-feature

# Step 5: Harden the plan (finalize before implementation)
specfact plan harden --bundle new-feature

# Step 6: Generate contracts from the plan
specfact generate contracts --bundle new-feature

# Step 7: Enforce SDD compliance
specfact enforce sdd --bundle new-feature
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Feature Idea] -->|plan init| B[Initialize Plan]
    B -->|plan add-feature| C[Add Features]
    C -->|plan add-story| D[Add User Stories]
    D -->|plan review| E[Review Plan]
    E -->|Issues| D
    E -->|Complete| F[plan harden]
    F -->|generate contracts| G[Generate Contracts]
    G -->|enforce sdd| H[SDD-Compliant Plan]
```

**Decision Points**:

- **After `plan init`**: Choose interactive mode to get guided prompts, or use flags for automation.
- **After `plan add-feature`**: Add multiple features before adding stories, or add stories immediately.
- **After `plan review`**: If ambiguities are found, add more details or stories before hardening.
- **After `plan harden`**: Once hardened, the plan is locked. Generate contracts before enforcement.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Complete plan bundle with features and stories
- Generated contracts ready for implementation
- SDD-compliant plan ready for development

## 3. External Tool Integration Chain

**Goal**: Integrate SpecFact with external tools like Spec-Kit, OpenSpec, or DevOps backlog tools (GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira).

**When to use**: You want to sync specifications between SpecFact and other tools, import from external sources, or integrate SpecFact into your agile DevOps workflows.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# For Code/Spec Adapters (Spec-Kit, OpenSpec, generic-markdown):
# Step 1: Import from external tool via bridge adapter
specfact import from-bridge --repo . --adapter speckit --write

# Step 2: Review the imported plan
specfact plan review <bundle-name>

# Step 3: Set up bidirectional sync (optional)
specfact sync bridge --adapter speckit --bundle <bundle-name> --bidirectional --watch

# Step 4: Enforce SDD compliance
specfact enforce sdd --bundle <bundle-name>

# For Backlog Adapters (GitHub Issues, ADO, Linear, Jira) - NEW FEATURE:
# Step 1: Export OpenSpec change proposals to GitHub Issues
specfact sync bridge --adapter github --bidirectional --repo-owner owner --repo-name repo

# Step 2: Import GitHub Issues as change proposals (if needed)
# (Automatic when using --bidirectional)

# Step 3: Track code changes automatically
specfact sync bridge --adapter github --track-code-changes --repo-owner owner --repo-name repo
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[External Tool] -->|import from-bridge| B[SpecFact Plan]
    B -->|plan review| C[Review Import]
    C -->|sync bridge| D[Bidirectional Sync]
    D -->|enforce sdd| E[SDD-Compliant]
    E -.->|watch mode| D
```

**Decision Points**:

- **After `import from-bridge`**: Review the imported plan. If it needs refinement, use `plan update-feature`.
- **Bidirectional sync**: Use `--watch` mode for continuous synchronization, or run sync manually as needed.
- **Adapter selection**: 
  - **Code/Spec adapters** (use `import from-bridge`): `speckit`, `openspec`, `generic-markdown`
  - **Backlog adapters** (use `sync bridge`): `github`, `ado`, `linear`, `jira`
  - **Note**: Backlog adapters (GitHub Issues, ADO, Linear, Jira) use `sync bridge` for bidirectional synchronization, not `import from-bridge`. The `import from-bridge` command is specifically for importing entire code/spec projects.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Specifications imported from external tool
- Bidirectional synchronization (if enabled)
- SDD-compliant integrated workflow

**Related Guides**:

## 4. API Contract Development Chain

**Goal**: Develop, validate, and test API contracts using SpecFact and Specmatic integration.

**When to use**: You're developing REST APIs and want to ensure contract compliance and backward compatibility.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Validate API specification
specfact spec validate --spec openapi.yaml

# Step 2: Check backward compatibility
specfact spec backward-compat --spec openapi.yaml --previous-spec openapi-v1.yaml

# Step 3: Generate tests from specification
specfact spec generate-tests --spec openapi.yaml --output tests/

# Step 4: Generate mock server (optional)
specfact spec mock --spec openapi.yaml --port 8080

# Step 5: Verify contracts at runtime
specfact contract verify --bundle api-bundle
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Specification] -->|spec validate| B[Validate Spec]
    B -->|spec backward-compat| C[Check Compatibility]
    C -->|spec generate-tests| D[Generate Tests]
    C -->|spec mock| E[Mock Server]
    D -->|contract verify| F[Verified Contracts]
    E --> F
```

**Decision Points**:

- **After `spec validate`**: If validation fails, fix the specification before proceeding.
- **Backward compatibility**: Check compatibility before releasing new API versions.
- **Mock server**: Use mock server for testing clients before implementation is complete.
- **Contract verification**: Run verification in CI/CD to catch contract violations early.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Validated API specification
- Backward compatibility verified
- Generated tests from specification
- Runtime contract verification

---

## 5. Sidecar Validation Chain

**Goal**: Validate external codebases (libraries, APIs, frameworks) without modifying source code.

**When to use**: You need to validate third-party libraries, legacy codebases, or APIs where you don't control the implementation.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize sidecar workspace
specfact validate sidecar init <bundle-name> <repo-path>

# Step 2: Run sidecar validation workflow
specfact validate sidecar run <bundle-name> <repo-path>

# Step 3: Review validation results
# Results are saved to .specfact/projects/<bundle>/reports/sidecar/
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External Repository] -->|validate sidecar init| B[Initialize Workspace]
    B --> C[Detect Framework]
    C --> D[Extract Routes/Schemas]
    D --> E[Populate Contracts]
    E --> F[Generate Harness]
    F -->|CrossHair| G[Symbolic Execution]
    F -->|Specmatic| H[Contract Testing]
    G --> I[Validation Results]
    H --> I
```

**Decision Points**:

- **After `validate sidecar init`**: Review detected framework and configuration. Adjust if needed.
- **Framework detection**: System automatically detects Django, FastAPI, DRF, Flask, or pure Python. Verify detection is correct.
- **Tool execution**: Use `--no-run-crosshair` or `--no-run-specmatic` to skip specific tools if not needed.
- **After `validate sidecar run`**: Review validation results. Fix issues in contracts or harness if needed.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Sidecar workspace initialized with framework-specific configuration
- Routes and schemas extracted from framework patterns
- OpenAPI contracts populated with extracted data
- CrossHair harness generated from contracts
- Validation results (CrossHair analysis, Specmatic testing)
- Reports saved to sidecar reports directory

## 6. Plan Promotion & Release Chain

**Goal**: Promote a plan through stages (draft → review → approved → released) and manage versions.

**When to use**: You have a completed plan and want to promote it through your organization's approval process.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Review the plan before promotion
specfact plan review <bundle-name>

# Step 2: Enforce SDD compliance
specfact enforce sdd --bundle <bundle-name>

# Step 3: Promote the plan to next stage
specfact plan promote --bundle <bundle-name> --stage <next-stage>

# Step 4: Bump version when releasing
specfact project version bump --bundle <bundle-name> --type <major|minor|patch>
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Draft Plan] -->|plan review| B[Review]
    B -->|enforce sdd| C[SDD Compliant]
    C -->|plan promote| D[Next Stage]
    D -->|version bump| E[Released]
```

**Decision Points**:

- **After `plan review`**: If issues are found, fix them before promotion.
- **SDD enforcement**: Ensure compliance before promoting to production stages.
- **Version bumping**: Choose appropriate version type (major/minor/patch) based on changes.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Plan promoted through approval stages
- Version bumped appropriately
- Release-ready plan bundle

## 7. Code-to-Plan Comparison Chain

**Goal**: Detect and resolve drift between code and specifications.

**When to use**: You want to ensure your code matches your specifications, or detect when code has diverged.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Import current code state
specfact code import current-state --repo .

# Step 2: Compare code against plan
specfact plan compare --bundle <plan-bundle> --code-vs-plan

# Step 3: Detect drift
specfact drift detect --bundle <bundle-name>

# Step 4: Sync repository (if drift found)
specfact sync repository --bundle <bundle-name> --direction <code-to-plan|plan-to-code>
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Code Repository] -->|import from-code| B[Current State]
    B -->|plan compare| C[Compare]
    C -->|drift detect| D[Drift Found?]
    D -->|Yes| E[sync repository]
    D -->|No| F[In Sync]
    E --> F
```

**Decision Points**:

- **After `plan compare`**: Review the comparison results to understand differences.
- **Drift detection**: If drift is detected, decide whether to sync code-to-plan or plan-to-code.
- **Sync direction**: Choose `code-to-plan` to update plan from code, or `plan-to-code` to update code from plan.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Code and plan synchronized
- Drift detected and resolved
- Consistent state between code and specifications

## 8. AI-Assisted Code Enhancement Chain (Emerging)

**Goal**: Use AI IDE integration to enhance code with contracts and validate them.

**When to use**: You want to add contracts to existing code using AI assistance in your IDE.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate contract prompt for AI IDE
specfact generate contracts-prompt --bundle <bundle-name> --feature <feature-id>

# Step 2: [In AI IDE] Use slash command to apply contracts
# /specfact-cli/contracts-apply <prompt-file>

# Step 3: Check contract coverage
specfact contract coverage --bundle <bundle-name>

# Step 4: Run validation
specfact repro --verbose
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Code Without Contracts] -->|generate contracts-prompt| B[AI Prompt]
    B -->|AI IDE| C[Apply Contracts]
    C -->|contract coverage| D[Check Coverage]
    D -->|repro| E[Validated Code]
```

**Decision Points**:

- **After generating prompt**: Review the prompt in your AI IDE before applying.
- **Contract coverage**: Ensure coverage meets your requirements before validation.
- **Validation**: If validation fails, review and fix contracts, then re-run.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Contracts added to code via AI assistance
- Contract coverage verified
- Validated enhanced code

## 11. SDD Constitution Management Chain

**Goal**: Manage Spec-Driven Development (SDD) constitutions for Spec-Kit compatibility.

**When to use**: You're working with Spec-Kit format and need to bootstrap, enrich, or validate constitutions.

**Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Bootstrap constitution from repository
specfact sdd constitution bootstrap --repo .

# Step 2: Enrich constitution with repository context
specfact sdd constitution enrich --repo .

# Step 3: Validate constitution completeness
specfact sdd constitution validate

# Step 4: List SDD manifests
specfact sdd list
```

**Workflow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Repository] -->|sdd constitution bootstrap| B[Bootstrap Constitution]
    B -->|sdd constitution enrich| C[Enrich Constitution]
    C -->|sdd constitution validate| D[Validate Constitution]
    D -->|sdd list| E[SDD Manifests]
    D -->|Issues Found| C
```

**Decision Points**:

- **Bootstrap vs Enrich**: Use `bootstrap` for new constitutions, `enrich` for existing ones.
- **Validation**: Run validation after bootstrap/enrich to ensure completeness.
- **Spec-Kit Compatibility**: These commands are for Spec-Kit format only. SpecFact uses modular project bundles internally.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Complete SDD constitution for Spec-Kit compatibility
- Validated constitution ready for use
- List of SDD manifests in repository
