# Dual-Stack Enrichment Pattern

**Status**: ✅ **AVAILABLE** (v0.13.0+)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-23  
**Version**: v0.20.4 (enrichment parser improvements: story merging, format validation)

---

## Overview

The **Dual-Stack Enrichment Pattern** is SpecFact's approach to combining CLI automation with AI IDE (LLM) capabilities. It ensures that all artifacts are CLI-generated and validated, while allowing LLMs to add semantic understanding and enhancements.

## Core Principle

**ALWAYS use the SpecFact CLI as the primary tool**. LLM enrichment is a **secondary layer** that enhances CLI output with semantic understanding, but **never replaces CLI artifact creation**.

## CLI vs LLM Capabilities

### CLI-Only Operations (CI/CD Mode - No LLM Required)

The CLI can perform these operations **without LLM**:

- ✅ Tool execution (ruff, pylint, basedpyright, mypy, semgrep, specmatic)
- ✅ Bundle management (create, load, save, validate structure)
- ✅ Metadata management (timestamps, hashes, telemetry)
- ✅ Planning operations (init, add-feature, add-story, update-idea, update-feature)
- ✅ AST/Semgrep-based analysis (code structure, patterns, relationships)
- ✅ Specmatic validation (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI contract validation)
- ✅ Format validation (YAML/JSON schema compliance)
- ✅ Source tracking and drift detection

**CRITICAL LIMITATIONS**:

- ❌ **CANNOT generate code** - No LLM available in CLI-only mode
- ❌ **CANNOT do reasoning** - No semantic understanding without LLM

### LLM-Required Operations (AI IDE Mode - Via Slash Prompts)

These operations **require LLM** and are only available via AI IDE slash prompts:

- ✅ Code generation (requires LLM reasoning)
- ✅ Code enhancement (contracts, refactoring, improvements)
- ✅ Semantic understanding (business logic, context, priorities)
- ✅ Plan enrichment (missing features, confidence adjustments, business context)
- ✅ Code reasoning (why decisions were made, trade-offs, constraints)

**Access**: Only available via AI IDE slash prompts (Cursor, CoPilot, etc.)  
**Pattern**: Slash prompt → LLM generates → CLI validates → Apply if valid

## Three-Phase Workflow

When working with AI IDE slash prompts, follow this three-phase workflow:

### Phase 1: CLI Grounding (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Execute CLI to get structured output
specfact <command> [options] --no-interactive
```

**Capture**:

- CLI-generated artifacts (plan bundles, reports)
- Metadata (timestamps, confidence scores)
- Telemetry (execution time, file counts)

### Phase 2: LLM Enrichment (OPTIONAL, Copilot Only)

**Purpose**: Add semantic understanding to CLI output

**What to do**:

- Read CLI-generated artifacts (use file reading tools for display only)
- Research codebase for additional context
- Identify missing features/stories
- Suggest confidence adjustments
- Extract business context
- **CRITICAL**: Generate enrichment report in the exact format specified below (see "Enrichment Report Format" section)

**What NOT to do**:

- ❌ Create YAML/JSON artifacts directly
- ❌ Modify CLI artifacts directly (use CLI commands to update)
- ❌ Bypass CLI validation
- ❌ Write to `.specfact/` folder directly (always use CLI)
- ❌ Use direct file manipulation tools for writing (use CLI commands)
- ❌ Deviate from the enrichment report format (will cause parsing failures)

**Output**: Generate enrichment report (Markdown) saved to `.specfact/projects/<bundle-name>/reports/enrichment/` (bundle-specific, Phase 8.5)

**Enrichment Report Format** (REQUIRED for successful parsing):

The enrichment parser expects a specific Markdown format. Follow this structure exactly:

```markdown
# [Bundle Name] Enrichment Report

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS  
**Bundle**: <bundle-name>

## Missing Features

1. **Feature Title** (Key: FEATURE-XXX)
   - Confidence: 0.85
   - Outcomes: outcome1, outcome2, outcome3
   - Stories:
     1. Story title here
        - Acceptance: criterion1, criterion2, criterion3
     2. Another story title
        - Acceptance: criterion1, criterion2

2. **Another Feature** (Key: FEATURE-YYY)
   - Confidence: 0.80
   - Outcomes: outcome1, outcome2
   - Stories:
     1. Story title
        - Acceptance: criterion1, criterion2, criterion3

## Confidence Adjustments

- FEATURE-EXISTING-KEY: 0.90 (reason: improved understanding after code review)

## Business Context

- Priority: High priority feature for core functionality
- Constraint: Must support both REST and GraphQL APIs
- Risk: Potential performance issues with large datasets
```

**Format Requirements**:

1. **Section Header**: Must use `## Missing Features` (case-insensitive, but prefer this exact format)
2. **Feature Format**:
   - Numbered list: `1. **Feature Title** (Key: FEATURE-XXX)`
   - **Bold title** is required (use `**Title**`)
   - **Key in parentheses**: `(Key: FEATURE-XXX)` - must be uppercase, alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores
   - Fields on separate lines with `-` prefix:
     - `- Confidence: 0.85` (float between 0.0-1.0)
     - `- Outcomes: comma-separated or line-separated list`
     - `- Stories:` (required - each feature must have at least one story)
3. **Stories Format**:
   - Numbered list under `Stories:` section: `1. Story title`
   - **Indentation**: Stories must be indented (2-4 spaces) under the feature
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: `- Acceptance: criterion1, criterion2, criterion3`
     - Can be comma-separated on one line
     - Or multi-line (each criterion on new line)
     - Must start with `- Acceptance:`
4. **Optional Sections**:
   - `## Confidence Adjustments`: List existing features with confidence updates
   - `## Business Context`: Priorities, constraints, risks (bullet points)
5. **File Naming**: `<bundle-name>-<timestamp>.enrichment.md` (e.g., `djangogoat-2025-12-23T23-50-00.enrichment.md`)

**Example** (working format):

```markdown
## Missing Features

1. **User Authentication** (Key: FEATURE-USER-AUTHENTICATION)
   - Confidence: 0.85
   - Outcomes: User registration, login, profile management
   - Stories:
     1. User can sign up for new account
        - Acceptance: sign_up view processes POST requests, creates User automatically, user is logged in after signup, redirects to profile page
     2. User can log in with credentials
        - Acceptance: log_in view authenticates username/password, on success user is logged in and redirected, on failure error message is displayed
```

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:

- ❌ Missing `(Key: FEATURE-XXX)` - parser needs this to identify features
- ❌ Missing `Stories:` section - every feature must have at least one story
- ❌ Stories not indented - parser expects indented numbered lists
- ❌ Missing `- Acceptance:` prefix - acceptance criteria won't be parsed
- ❌ Using bullet points (`-`) instead of numbers (`1.`) for stories
- ❌ Feature title not in bold (`**Title**`) - parser may not extract title correctly

**Important Notes**:

- **Stories are merged**: When updating existing features (not creating new ones), stories from the enrichment report are merged into the existing feature. New stories are added, existing stories are preserved.
- **Feature titles updated**: If a feature exists but has an empty title, the enrichment report will update it.
- **Validation**: The enrichment parser validates the format and will fail with clear error messages if the format is incorrect.

### Phase 3: CLI Artifact Creation (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Use enrichment to update plan via CLI
specfact import from-code [<bundle-name>] --repo <path> --enrichment <enrichment-report> --no-interactive
```

**Result**: Final artifacts are CLI-generated with validated enrichments

**What happens during enrichment application**:

- Missing features are added with their stories and acceptance criteria
- Existing features are updated (confidence, outcomes, title if empty)
- Stories are merged into existing features (new stories added, existing preserved)
- Business context is applied to the plan bundle
- All changes are validated and saved via CLI

## Standard Validation Loop Pattern (For LLM-Generated Code)

When generating or enhancing code via LLM, **ALWAYS** follow this pattern:

```text
1. CLI Prompt Generation (Required)
   ↓
   CLI generates structured prompt → saved to .specfact/prompts/
   (e.g., `generate contracts-prompt`, future: `generate code-prompt`)

2. LLM Execution (Required - AI IDE Only)
   ↓
   LLM reads prompt → generates enhanced code → writes to TEMPORARY file
   (NEVER writes directly to original artifacts)
   Pattern: `enhanced_<filename>.py` or `generated_<feature>.py`

3. CLI Validation Loop (Required, up to N retries)
   ↓
   CLI validates temp file with all relevant tools:
   - Syntax validation (py_compile)
   - File size check (must be >= original)
   - AST structure comparison (preserve functions/classes)
   - Contract imports verification
   - Code quality checks (ruff, pylint, basedpyright, mypy)
   - Test execution (contract-test, pytest)
   ↓
   If validation fails:
   - CLI provides detailed error feedback
   - LLM fixes issues in temp file
   - Re-validate (max 3 attempts)
   ↓
   If validation succeeds:
   - CLI applies changes to original file
   - CLI removes temporary file
   - CLI updates metadata/telemetry
```

**This pattern must be used for**:

- ✅ Contract enhancement (`generate contracts-prompt` / `contracts-apply`) - Already implemented
- ⏳ Code generation (future: `generate code-prompt` / `code-apply`) - Needs implementation
- ⏳ Plan enrichment (future: `plan enrich-prompt` / `enrich-apply`) - Needs implementation
- ⏳ Any LLM-enhanced artifact modification - Needs implementation

## Example: Contract Enhancement Workflow

This is a real example of the validation loop pattern in action:

### Step 1: Generate Prompt

```bash
specfact generate contracts-prompt src/auth/login.py --apply beartype,icontract --bundle legacy-api
```

**Result**: Prompt saved to `.specfact/projects/legacy-api/prompts/enhance-login-beartype-icontract.md`

### Step 2: LLM Enhances Code

1. AI IDE reads the prompt file
2. AI IDE reads the original file (`src/auth/login.py`)
3. AI IDE generates enhanced code with contracts
4. AI IDE writes to temporary file: `enhanced_login.py`
5. **DO NOT modify original file directly**

### Step 3: Validate and Apply

```bash
specfact generate contracts-apply enhanced_login.py --original src/auth/login.py
```

**Validation includes**:

- Syntax validation
- File size check
- AST structure comparison
- Contract imports verification
- Code quality checks
- Test execution

**If validation fails**:

- Review error messages
- Fix issues in `enhanced_login.py`
- Re-run validation (up to 3 attempts)

**If validation succeeds**:

- CLI applies changes to `src/auth/login.py`
- CLI removes `enhanced_login.py`
- CLI updates metadata/telemetry

## Why This Pattern?

### Benefits

- ✅ **Format Consistency**: All artifacts match CLI schema versions
- ✅ **Traceability**: CLI metadata tracks who/what/when
- ✅ **Validation**: CLI ensures schema compliance
- ✅ **Reliability**: Works in both Copilot and CI/CD
- ✅ **No Format Drift**: CLI-generated artifacts always match current schema

### What Happens If You Don't Follow

- ❌ Artifacts may not match CLI schema versions
- ❌ Missing metadata and telemetry
- ❌ Format inconsistencies
- ❌ Validation failures
- ❌ Works only in Copilot mode, fails in CI/CD
- ❌ Code generation attempts in CLI-only mode will fail (no LLM available)

## Rules

1. **Execute CLI First**: Always run CLI commands before any analysis
2. **Use CLI for Writes**: All write operations must go through CLI
3. **Read for Display Only**: Use file reading tools for display/analysis only
4. **Never Modify .specfact/**: Do not create/modify files in `.specfact/` directly
5. **Never Bypass Validation**: CLI ensures schema compliance and metadata
6. **Code Generation Requires LLM**: Code generation is only possible via AI IDE slash prompts, not CLI-only
7. **Use Validation Loop**: All LLM-generated code must follow the validation loop pattern

## Available CLI Commands

- `specfact plan init <bundle-name>` - Initialize project bundle
- `specfact plan select <bundle-name>` - Set active plan (used as default for other commands)
- `specfact import from-code [<bundle-name>] --repo <path>` - Import from codebase (uses active plan if bundle not specified)
- `specfact plan review [<bundle-name>]` - Review plan (uses active plan if bundle not specified)
- `specfact plan harden [<bundle-name>]` - Create SDD manifest (uses active plan if bundle not specified)
- `specfact enforce sdd [<bundle-name>]` - Validate SDD (uses active plan if bundle not specified)
- `specfact generate contracts-prompt <file> --apply <contracts>` - Generate contract enhancement prompt
- `specfact generate contracts-apply <enhanced-file> --original <original-file>` - Validate and apply enhanced code
- `specfact sync bridge --adapter <adapter> --repo <path>` - Sync with external tools
- See [Command Reference](../reference/commands.md) for full list

**Note**: Most commands now support active plan fallback. If `--bundle` is not specified, commands automatically use the active plan set via `plan select`. This improves workflow efficiency in AI IDE environments.
