## Contract-First Testing Evidence

**Required for all changes affecting CLI commands or public APIs:**

### Contract Validation

- [ ] **Runtime contracts added/updated** (`@icontract` decorators on public APIs)
- [ ] **Type checking enforced** (`@beartype` decorators applied)
- [ ] **CrossHair exploration** completed: `hatch run contract-test-exploration`
- [ ] **Contract violations** reviewed and addressed

### Test Execution

- [ ] **Contract validation**: `hatch run contract-test-contracts` ✅
- [ ] **Contract exploration**: `hatch run contract-test-exploration` ✅
- [ ] **Scenario tests**: `hatch run contract-test-scenarios` ✅
- [ ] **Full test suite**: `hatch run contract-test-full` ✅

### Test Quality

- [ ] **CLI commands tested** with typer test client
- [ ] **Edge cases covered** with Hypothesis property tests
- [ ] **Error handling tested** with invalid inputs
- [ ] **Rich console output verified** manually or with snapshots

## How Has This Been Tested?

**Contract-First Approach**: Describe how contracts and scenario tests validate your changes.

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Tested CLI commands manually
- [ ] Verified rich console output
- [ ] Tested with different input scenarios
- [ ] Checked error messages for clarity

### Automated Testing

- [ ] Contract validation passes
- [ ] Property-based tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Scenario tests cover user workflows
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

### Test Environment

- Python version: (e.g., 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- OS: (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 14, Windows 11)
